# etch-a-sketch
----------------------------------
this is a Javascript Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

## Assigment
  * **Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.**
    * **Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try to create them by hand by copying and pasting them in your HTML file!**
    * **It’s best to put your grid squares inside a “container” div. This div can be written in your HTML file.**
    * **Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Despite the name, do not be tempted to research or use CSS Grid, as it will be taught in a later lesson after the foundations path. This project is an opportunity specifically to practice Flexbox!**
    * **Be careful with borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares!**
